<h1> Chapter 1: An Unexpected Party </h1>
<h2> J.R.R. Tolkien </h2>
<p1> In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. </p2>
